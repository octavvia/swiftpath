# ðŸš€ SwiftUI Learning Journey

This repository documents my journey in learning **SwiftUI** from scratch using the [SwiftUI Handbook](https://designcode.io/swiftui-handbook) by Design+Code. 

## ðŸ“Œ Why SwiftUI?
SwiftUI provides a **declarative** way to build user interfaces across all Apple platforms with less code and more flexibility. As a **Flutter and SwiftUI developer**, I aim to master SwiftUI to create modern, scalable, and efficient iOS applications.
